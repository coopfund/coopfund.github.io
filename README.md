Coop Fund is an experimental cooperative funding platform that accumulates financial resources through member contributions, and redistributes small funds to members using a cooperative decision making process.

Static html site adapted from the [original coop fund site](https://github.com/coopfund/coopfund.github.io/tree/deprecated-js-npm-site) to allow updating without the need for web development tools.
